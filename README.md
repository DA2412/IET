# About IET
IET (Inverse Equilibrium Tool) is a MATLAB computational tool constituted by three main modules, each with a dedicated GUI. It allows to compute the coil currents needed to obtain a predetermined plasma shape with defined plasma global parameters (i.e. total plasma current and total poloidal magnetic flux at the boundary) by solving a constrained minimization problem. 

IET was validated for both ITER-like plasma configurations and experimental plasmas in the RFX-mod experiment.  The journal publication of IET code can be found here: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6587/ab3f09
